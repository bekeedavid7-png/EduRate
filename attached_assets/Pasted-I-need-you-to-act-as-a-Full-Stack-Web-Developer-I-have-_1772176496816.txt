I need you to act as a Full-Stack Web Developer. I have imported my entire project, and I want you to analyze the existing codebase and implement several critical features and fixes based on the provided design specifications and logic flows.

**Project Overview:**
This is an education evaluation platform called 'EDURATE'. The current state is just a skeleton. The frontend is built in React, and the backend needs to be connected to handle data properly. My database is.

**Visual References:**
I have provided three images showing the intended user interface of the Student Dashboard (which is partially implemented):
* **Image 0:** Shows the main 'My Dashboard' with filtering by department and a list of courses. Each course has a 'Start Evaluation' button.
* **Image 1:** Shows the same dashboard further down the list, and a blue 'Pending Evaluations Summary' section below the course list.
* **Image 2:** Shows a close-up of the 'Pending Evaluations Summary' with specific courses like CS101 and MATH201.

**Deliverables & Feature Implementation Flow:**

I need you to complete the following multi-step workflow. You must analyze the existing files to understand current data structures before writing new code.

### Step 1: Student Evaluation Flow (Fix and Implement)

**1.1 Fix the Evaluation Submission:**
Analyze the frontend code for the course card. Currently, the 'Start Evaluation' button (see Image 0) only visualizes a state change. We need to implement a full submission flow:
* Identify the code responsible for the 'Start Evaluation' flow. When clicked, it should render an actual evaluation form (create a basic form if one doesn't exist) for that specific course and lecturer.
* Create an `evaluation submission` API endpoint on the backend.
* Connect the 'submit' button on the form to this backend endpoint to save the evaluation data.

**1.2 Implement the "Completed Evaluations" Section:**
Currently, there is a 'My Evaluations' link in the header and a 'Pending Evaluations Summary' section at the bottom (Image 1 and 2). We need a new, distinct section on the dashboard called "Completed Evaluations".
* Modify the dashboard layout to include a "Completed Evaluations" section (visually similar in structure to the main course list from Image 0, but without 'Start Evaluation' buttons).
* Create a backend endpoint to fetch only a student's completed evaluations.
* **Crucial Logic:** When a student successfully submits an evaluation (via 1.1), that course must *move* dynamically:
    1.  It must be removed from the main "My Dashboard" list.
    2.  It must be removed from the 'Pending Evaluations Summary' list.
    3.  It must be added to the new "Completed Evaluations" section.

### Step 2: Lecturer Signup and Profile Creation

**2.1 Dynamic Lecturer Onboarding:**
Create a comprehensive SignUp/Profile Setup page specifically for Lecturers. This cannot be a generic signup. When a lecturer signs up, they must define their academic profile:
* **Name:** (Self-explanatory)
* **Department Choice:** A dropdown list populated by the same departments seen in the filters in Image 0 (e.g., Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics).
* **Related Courses:** When a department is selected, dynamically populate a second dropdown listing only the courses relevant to that department (e.g., selecting 'Computer Science' lists CS101). The lecturer must select the specific course they teach.

**2.2 Database Integration:**
Upon form submission, update the backend database schema/tables:
* Create or update a `Lecturers` table/collection.
* This new lecturer must be added to the master list, linked to their chosen Department and specific Course. This new lecturer should now appear dynamically in the Student Dashboard dropdowns or data fetching if a student selects that department.

### Step 3: Lecturer Dashboard & Analytics

Create a completely new page route: `/lecturer/dashboard`.

**3.1 Implement the 'My Courses' Section:**
This section of the lecturer's dashboard should be filtered automatically.
* **Crucial Logic:** It should *only* display the specific course the lecturer chose during their signup process (from Step 2.1).

**3.2 Implement Data Visualization (Charts):**
Create a section on the Lecturer Dashboard for "Evaluation Summary".
* This section must fetch the summary of evaluation data *specifically* for that lecturer from the `completed evaluations` (referencing Step 1.2).
* Implement data visualization using a library like `Chart.js` or `Recharts`.
* You must present the evaluation data in two formats:
    * **A Bar Chart:** (e.g., showing the average score for key evaluation criteria).
    * **A Pie Chart:** (e.g., showing the distribution of ratings, like percentage of 'Excellent', 'Good', 'Average' ratings).

### Implementation Instructions for Replit:
1.  **Analyze first:** Thoroughly review the entire uploaded file structure to understand the existing setup.
2.  **Define a DB Schema:** If one isn't clearly defined, create a proposed schema for Students, Lecturers, Courses, and Evaluations that supports this workflow.
3.  **Build incrementally:** Don't try to generate everything at once. Focus on one flow at a time (e.g., Student flow first).
4.  **Backend Focus:** The majority of these requests are heavy backend and database tasks. I need you to build the API endpoints and database interactions before trying to wire up the frontend charts.

Please start by summarizing the existing project structure and proposing a plan of attack.
